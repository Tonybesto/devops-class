## Introduction to GitOps:
GitOps is a software development and operations (DevOps) methodology that leverages Git as the single source of truth for managing infrastructure and application deployments. With GitOps, the desired state of the system is defined in Git repositories, and tools automate the process of applying those changes to the target environment.

### Why use GitOps:

- Infrastructure as Code: GitOps treats infrastructure and application configuration as code, enabling version control, collaboration, and reproducibility.
- Continuous Delivery: GitOps enables a continuous delivery workflow, where any changes committed to Git are automatically deployed to the target environment.
- Auditing and Rollbacks: Git provides an audit trail of all changes, allowing easy rollbacks to previous states if issues occur.
- Consistency and Standardization: GitOps ensures consistent and standardized deployments across different environments.

### Using GitOps with Kubernetes:
GitOps is particularly well-suited for managing Kubernetes clusters. Kubernetes resources, such as deployments, services, and configurations, can be defined in Git repositories, and GitOps tools take care of synchronizing the desired state with the actual cluster.

### Steps to use GitOps with Kubernetes:

1. Set up a Git repository: Create a Git repository to store the desired state of your Kubernetes cluster. This repository will hold the configuration files for your Kubernetes resources.
2. Define the desired state: Create YAML files for your Kubernetes resources (deployments, services, etc.) in the Git repository. Ensure that the files reflect the desired state of your cluster.
3. GitOps tool installation: Install a GitOps tool like FluxCD, which will continuously monitor the Git repository and apply changes to the Kubernetes cluster.
4. Configure GitOps tool: Connect the GitOps tool to the Git repository and provide necessary access credentials. Specify the target Kubernetes cluster for deploying changes.
5. Automation and synchronization: The GitOps tool will monitor the Git repository for changes. Any new commits or updates trigger the synchronization process, where the tool applies the changes to the Kubernetes cluster automatically.
